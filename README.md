## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

The following are three mobile applications that I use frequently, and reasons why I enjoy using them.

**Fidelity**

- Real-time updates on stock prices
- Using Face ID to make login more secure (but also faster)

**Audible**

- Set timers so the app closes after the specified time has passed
- Listen log that shows where I paused, skipped, replayed

**Spotify**

- Randomize what songs play next
- Play on another device

An app that I would like to build is a simple personal finance app that keeps track of expenses and income.
There are many apps out there that does this, so I'm really only interested in pursuing it as a learning
experience and also out of personal interest. A couple months ago I started learning a lot more about personal
finance, and I think this is a good way to connect my new hobby with my professional interest.

**Personal Finance App**

- User can input expenses and income
  - Income/expense can be separated into categories (rent, food, gifts, investments, misc.)
- Each expense/income will be logged, and daily/weekly/monthly/yearly reports can be displayed as a chart/graph      
  - This log can also be exported as an Excel/CSV file
 
I just want to focus on those basic features first, only adding more advanced features if there is demand for it or if I feel like it would be a QOL improvment. My philosophy is that finances should be kept as simple and easy as possible, and I want this app to reflect those values.

## Notes

I've never used XCode or Swift before so trying to learn a new language and platform at once was tough,
but the GIFs provided in the Prework document was very helpful when navigating through XCode. I know I'll
get better once I become more familiar with the XCode environment and coding some more in Swift.
